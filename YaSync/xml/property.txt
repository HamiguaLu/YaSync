StartDate (4 bytes): The date of the first occurrence. It is stored as the number of minutes between midnight, January 1, 1601, 
and midnight of the specified day.

as the end date.If the recurrence does not have an end date, the value of the EndDate field MUST be set to 0x5AE980DF.

StartTimeOffset (4 bytes): The number of minutes, since midnight, after which each occurrence starts. For example, the value for midnight is 0 (zero)
and the value for 12:00 P.M. is 720.

EndTimeOffset (4 bytes): The number of minutes, since midnight, after which each occurrence ends. For example, the value for midnight is 0 (zero)
